# pvclib (package version check)

## CURRENT VERSION IS IN DEVELOPEMENT AND DIDN'T PASS THE FINAL TEST FOR VERSION 0.1

## The Idea
The idea is that to create simple bash functions to check dependecies, errors etc and create automatic output information, for the user with solutions of the problem. Library is written in bash to easily transfer it to other languages like Python/C++/Perl/Rust as running functions by calling it. In a future i want tit to be a multi platform

## To do / things to improve:
1. Basically half of the code
2. argvs for debug mode + puting manager
3. Arrays with existing packages and versions as a "python like" dicts to make smaller cache problem with unwanted files (bash v4)
4. Error output of packages that doesnt exist
5. Control values
6. Function results with output of possible solution and breaks in some cases (If repo is not available)
7. Creates 2 different functions with different output of checking like MUST HAVE and MIGHT HAVE or SUGGESTED
8. Enter/space as input value error Handling
9. Check if there is installed 2 different drivers packages if there is only one GPU
10. Optimus checker
11. Dxvk check

## Contributing
For now closed if i make first proper functions it will be enable.
