# pvclib (package version check) [BROKEN]

## CURRENT VERSION IS IN DEVELOPEMENT AND DIDN'T PASS THE FINAL TEST FOR VERSION 0.1

## The Idea
The idea is that to create simple bash functions to check dependecies, errors etc and create automatic output information, for the user with solutions of the problem. Library is written in bash to easily transfer it to other languages like Python/C++/Perl/Rust as running functions by calling it. In a future i want tit to be a multi platform

## To do / things to improve:
- [x] checking system hardware
- [x] pacman commands (pacman.cfg)
- [ ] argvs for debug mode
- [ ] Control values
- [ ] Function results with output of possible solution and breaks in some cases (If repo is not available)
- [ ] MUST HAVE and MIGHT HAVE or SUGGESTED packages
- [ ] Enter/space as input value error Handling
- [ ] Dxvk check

## Contributing
For now closed if i make first proper functions it will be enable.
